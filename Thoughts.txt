Layout Dirty Flow
==========================

1. Mark self dirty
2. Mark all children dirty whose sizing/positioning depends on self sizing
3. Recursively mark parents either fully dirty if sizing positioning depends on self, or only mark children dirty otherwise

Dirty Flags
==========================

renderer dirty flag -> indicates to the renderer weather the documents needs to be redrawn.
geometry dirty flag -> indicates that the geometry of a dom node needs to be regenerated.


RenderLayer Managment
==========================
- if node is new, check if it needs its own RenderLayer:
    - if so, create it, add the node to it, and attach the new RenderLayer as a child to the last one.
    - if not, add the new node to the last RenderLayer

- if node is not new:
    - if it has no special RenderLayer, remove from last RenderLayer and add to the Render layer of the parent node
    - if it has a special RenderLayer, remove special RenderLayer from parent and add it as a child to the parent nodes RenderLayer


More advanced rendering for the future
Render Area Computation
==========================
- Tile based rendering approach
- Render Area is Viewport + x tiles on each edge



Render Dirty Flow
==========================

1. Only mark self dirty


SKIA???????


BoxNode
==========================

-- Generates the geometry for itself and its border
-- Generates the shadow for itself



ImageNode <- BoxNode
==========================

-- loads the image into a texture
-- Draws the same as boxnode but with its image texture


TextNode <- BoxNode
==========================

-- renders its text to a texture
-- possibly renders a text shadow, text stroke etc.
